\section{Conclusion}

The process of database design, including conceptual design, restructuring of the conceptual schema, direct translation to the relational model, and restructuring of the relational schema, has enabled us to build a comprehensive database for football clubs. The database is specifically designed to capture, manage, and track all pertinent information related to a football club, including its teams, players, contracts, captains, coaching staff, managers, sponsorships, and sponsors.
\newline


The SQL database translated from the restructured relational schema which connected to a user interactive Java application, offers an automated and structured way of managing a football club's information, providing insights into a clubâ€™s operations and performance over time. The records are not just current but historical, allowing for changes.
\newline


With this project, we aim not just to simplify the data management of football clubs, but also to provide a robust platform that can support the growth and evolution of clubs. The SQL and Java files, attached to this document, are the first steps towards this ambitious goal.
