\subsection{Final remarks}
By starting with the specifications of the domain and the idea for the project, we applied the four main phases of the design of a database. The restructured relational schema will be translated to an SQL specification and will be used by a Java Application that will interact with it. The SQL and Java files will be sent along with this document.\newline\newline
The database definition that has been described in the previous pages has been developed in response to a real need of a company environment based in Bolzano which operates in the retail field of snow retainment systems.
\newline\newline
The aim of this project is to develop a database that could enable the automatization of the companies processes involved in the production of supply offers and the calculation of snow retaining systems. The "so called" Snowstop database will enable employees of the company to easily perform calculations on the snow load of a particular building site and propose to customers a supply offer that will provide a tailored snow retaining system based on such calculations. The altitude and the dimensions of the roof for which a snow load calculation is perfomed will affect the actual amount of snow that will deposit on it and the type and resistance of the retaining system needed.
