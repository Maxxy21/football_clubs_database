\textbf{General statements:\\}
We want to realize a database for football clubs, aiming to represent data related to a team, its players and their positions, captain, coaching staff, manager, sponsor, and contracts between a team and a person. The database will track historical data for contracts, team captaincies, sponsorships, and managerial positions over time.

\vspace{12px}
\textbf{Statements concerning teams:\\}
For the teams, we identify them uniquely by a team ID and also record the name, the city they are located in, their year of foundation, and their kit colors.

\vspace{12px}
\textbf{Statements concerning persons:\\}
 For the persons, each of them is identified uniquely by an ID. We represent their name, date of birth and nationality. We want to keep track of the contract’s date and salaries they have received over time with a team.

 \vspace{12px}
\textbf{Statements concerning contracts:\\}
For the contracts, we track the contract ID, the start and end dates, salary, and the person and team associated with each contract. Jersey number and position are optional, and defined only if the contract is for a Player.

\vspace{12px}
\textbf{Statements concerning players:\\}
For the players, who are persons in a team, we are interested in their status in the starting XI and the number of appearances they have made.

\vspace{12px}
\textbf{Statements concerning captains:\\}
For the captains, we maintain a historical record of their captaincies, including the start and end date of each tenure.

\vspace{12px}
\textbf{Statements concerning coaching staff:\\}
For the coaching staff, who are also persons in a team, we are interested in their specific roles. They are responsible for training the players.

\vspace{12px}
\textbf{Statements concerning managers:\\}
 For the managers, who are part of the coaching staff, we represent the years of experience they have in management.

\vspace{12px}
\textbf{Statements concerning sponsorships:\\}
We track the sponsorships for both teams and players. For each sponsorship, we record its start date, end date, and type. It is identified by the combination of the team ID or player ID and the sponsor ID.

\vspace{12px}
